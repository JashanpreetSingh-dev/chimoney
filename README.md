# Project Guide
On starting the project using "npm start", the user will be directed to the list of Items page.

Every item has an `Add To Cart` button which can be used to quickly add the item to the cart.

Otherwise, the user can click on the item and as a result the user will be redirected to the product page. The user can add the product to cart from here as well.

On clicking the `Cart` icon on the top right of the navigation bar, the user gets redirected to the cart where they can increment or decrement the products that they added to the cart.

Finally they can click the `Checkout` button on the bottom of the cart to got to checkout form and on click `Proceed to Payment Options`, the cart gets emptied and everything comes back to ground 0.
